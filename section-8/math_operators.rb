# Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20
# Addition − Adds values on either side of the operator.

a = 10
b = 20
puts a + b # will give 30

# Subtraction − Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.
puts a - b # will give -10

# Multiplication − Multiplies values on either side of the operator.
puts a * b # will give 200

# Division − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand.
puts b / a # will give 2

# Modulus − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.
puts b % a # will give 0

# Exponent − Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators.
puts a**b
